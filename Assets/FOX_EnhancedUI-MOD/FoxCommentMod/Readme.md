Originally it's planned as a mod, like a script that will run and re draw existing UI

So... yeah, had to work in my own bounds (main reason why i didn't changed any interaction icons, database has *protected* field)
Plus I'm replacing some scripts with my own like a script that sets a Key tip icons.
Basically my scripts are useless, because they're just replacing graphics that can be easilly and Properly replaced in the Unity editor.
All the UI positioning an other things in "Fox's Enhancer" profab, so all my edited UI can be *easilly re-created* in appropriateway.



Not a final version of a mod, but most of the HUD was re-worked.
Still have to make a Settings menu, Inventory and... something else, I forgot.
