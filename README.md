## 2. What is Koboldkare?

KoboldKare is an adult video game. The focus of the game is to buy and grow your very own kobolds. The kobolds can be fed various reagents from various sources to do certain things like the breast expansion or inflation.

## 4. Core aspects

### 4.1 Locations

*Your Farm:* This is where you grow, store, and sell your kobolds. Your Farm currently comes with a Watersource, a grinder, a sellingpit, a kitchen and a bed.

*The Shop:* The shop is the place where you spend your money. This includes buckets, kobold eggs, milking stations and upgrades to your carrying capacity.

*The Wild:* Here you find Melons hidden between the trees.

### 4.2 Tools/Liquids

*Grinder:* This is one of the tools you'll use the most. At the beginning of a new game you have to pay 50$ to unlock it. To use it you just have to throw a melon or a kobold in from the top, but before that you should put a kobold or a bucket bellow it to catch the liquid spilling out. Be careful though that you don't fall in yourself, you'll die. Here's all the liquids you can get currently and what they do:

| Water      | Water the kobolds to make them grow!                                                                       |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MelonJuice | Causes breast growth in kobolds. Required to get Milk from kobolds.                                        |
| Milk       | Get it via milkers on kobolds with breasts. Has no use yet beyond being worth quite a bit of money though. |
| Blood      | Same as Milk. You can probably figure out how to get this stuff.                                           |

*Bucket:* This is where you store all sorts of liquids. To store liquids from the grinder, place it under it. To collect water, just dip it in the water hole. Press right-click while holding a bucket to spray it's contents on your kobolds. It's possible to mix different liquids togheter to combine their effects. when droped/thrown to hard, the bucket will splash, loosing it's content in the progress.

*Milking station:* Attach the tube to your kobold to milk them. Only kobolds with with breastgrowth can be milked. The collected milk spills out on the outlet, so place a bucket there before you start milking. To detach a kobold from the station, drag the kobold far away from it. Make sure to milk both breasts for maximum efficiency!

*Sellingpit:* Throw your kobolds or melons in there to make money. Jumping in yourself will kill you.

*Kitchen:* Here you can safely store kobolds/melons to prevent them from spoiling. At the start of the game theres 1 crate and 1 melon in the kitchen.

*Bed:* You can sleep here to skip time forward to 7:00 AM.

*Shop:* Here you can buy stuff. Press E on an object to buy it.

*Crate:* Each crate includes an Egg. Place the crates near the pond and then activate them with E to spawn an Egg.

*Increased grab capacity:* Each time you buy this upgrade, you can hold one more additional item, doesn't matter what item.

*Melon:* Grind them and feed them to your kobolds to grow their breasts. They spawn randomly in the wild and respawn each time you sleep/die.

### 4.3 Kobolds/stages

All kobolds are the same and start as crates. After you place the crates and spawn eggs, you have to water them with buckets until you can see heart pop up. Once that's done for all eggs, you either wait or just go to your bed. After waiting long enough, or after sleeping, you will have hatchlings. Repeat the same process again. After waiting/sleeping one more time you now have fully grown kobolds.

### 4.4 Spoilage

If you leave kobolds/melons/unwatered eggs and hatchlings outside the kitchen, they will disappear if you wait too long or sleep/die.

## 5. How to get started

Some people want to have a house full of kobolds while others may want one giant kobold waifu, but no matter which preferences you have, you'll need money. Lots of it. Your main priority is to unlock the grinder to process liquids. At the begining of the game, take the crate from the kitchen and the one outside to the pond and do your thing until all 3 kobolds are fully grown. After that, put them in the pond to inflate them, this will raise their value a fair bit. Then sell them and buy 3-4 more kobolds and repeat the entire process. After you sell these kobolds, you should have enough money to unlock the grinder. After unlocking the grinder, get buy some more kobolds and grow them. Once you have grown kobolds again, go to the wilds and collect a melon for each kobold. Then, place a kobold under the grinder and throw a melon in the grinder, this will cause substantial breast growth which increases your kobolds value by alot, repeat this with each kobold you have and dip them in the pond again for extra value and then sell them off.

And that's it, after that you should spend excess money on increased grab capacity to lessen the amounts of trips to the shop/wilds and then you can easily grow Thicc kobolds for lotsa money.

## 6. Tips and tricks

Theres several little tricks you can do to make each proccess smoother and more efficient. Here's the list:

* Hold jump while moving to start bunnyhoping, it takes some practice to control, but its' much, MUCH faster than walking. This also works while carrying objects and uphill.
* When transporting objects, like crates from the shop, it's best to pick them up and then throw them towards your destination than walking back and forth for each object, this also works when carrying multiple objects.
* When collecting Melons, you can also throw them into the river, they will slowly slide all the way down, this is especially usefull if you dont have any/few grab capacity upgrades.
* When grinding kobolds/melons it's better to place a kobold under the grinder than placing a bucket and then spraying it's content on the kobolds. Not only does it take less steps, but you also won't have to worry of excess liquids being wasted when you grind to much. This is especially true for melons as this method causes like 5x bigger breast growth than with the bucket method.
* If you want to collect blood, you don't have to waste a kobold, you can just grind yourself! In this case you have to use a bucket as your death causes everything outside the kitchen to despawn. The best time to do this is after you sold your last batch of kobolds and watered some new eggs.
* Instead of walking back into your house to sleep, you can also just press Q to suicide, it's the same effect as sleeping.
